# The history

I left Songbird and begin using Rhythmbox but the repeat one song feature was not present. I cried ... a lot, but from scratch I did learn some Python and Rhythmbox plugins idea and poof! the plugin is here.

# Installation

Copy the "repeat-one-song" folder and paste it in ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/

# Usage

Open Rhythmbox and load the plugin by "Rhythmbox (menu) -> Plugins", select the "Repeat One Song" in the list. Activate the plugin by going on Rhythmbox -> Plugins -> Repeat One Song. To repeat the current song go to Edit (menu) -> Repeat current song, or use Ctrl + E shortcut.

# Contact me

Any doubt, suggestion or anything else, except asking for some money, I would be pleased to received a message from you. :¬)
