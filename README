# The history

I left Songbird and begin using Rhythmbox but the repeat one song feature was not present. I cried ... a lot, but from scratch I did learn some Python and Rhythmbox plugins idea and poof! the plugin is here.

# Installation

Copy the "repeat-one-song" folder and paste it in ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/ -- If "plugins" directory does not exist, just create it. If the "rhythmbox" directory does not exist, paste the "repeat-one-song" folder in /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins directory.

# Usage

Open Rhythmbox and load the plugin by "Edit (menu) -> Plug-ins", select the "Repeat One Song" in the list. Activate the plugin by "Control (menu) -> Repeat one", or click in the Toolbar button that shows the Repeat one icon, or you can use the marvelous shortcut Ctrl+E. In version 0.0.5 you can define the number of repetitions for the current song in the Preferences dialog: "Edit (menu) -> Plug-ins", select "Repeat One Song" and "Configure" button will be available in the right panel.
